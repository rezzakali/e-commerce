          orders placed for products listed at an incorrect price, whether or
          not the order has been confirmed and your credit card charged. If your

          by either you or e-Shop. You may terminate these Terms and Conditions
          at any time by discontinuing use of our website. e-Shop may also
          terminate these Terms and Conditions at any time and may do so
          immediately without notice, and accordingly deny you access to our

        </p>
        <h4>Limitation of Liability</h4>
        <p>
          e-Shop shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental,
          special, or consequential damages that result from the use of, or the
          inability to use, our website or materials on or from our website,
          even if e-Shop has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
          Applicable law may not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability
